        <h5 class="text-muted">At William Torbitt Primary School we aim to provide a diet of education that is fun and creative for our pupils; a curriculum which is broad and balanced and inspires them to be lifelong learners; a curriculum that is diverse and individualised to the different cultures and religions represented in our school; a curriculum that is taught through the eyes of the child, where they have had their say and been part of the design and make-up of what takes place – a person centred approach. We aim to equip our pupils with the knowledge, skills and vocabulary they need to be successful both during their time at William Torbitt and as they head out into the future.</h5>

        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">We have regular guided reading session which are delivered using the Reciprocal Teaching approach. This is done in groups as well as individual reading for pupils who are at the earlier stages of learning to read.  Our teachers record our progress as we read. We also have reading journals or home liaison books diaries and we, our teachers and our parents write comments to each other about how well we are doing.We have a lot of books to choose from for guided reading and individual reading. At William Torbitt we use a mixture of real books and reading scheme books,which have been organised into a colour banding system for the younger pupils.</h5>

        <p class="text-muted">As the assembly starts and we begin to include some questions and conversations, the children’s hesitation fades. Hands shoot up in the air, opinions are shared, and vast knowledge is revealed. The pupils show how aware they are of the climate crisis and the environmental problems around them. They tell us what they know about carbon footprint and biodiversity and how composting works. When we wrap up the assembly and the children leave to change their footwear, their faces are beaming with excitement and their voices reveal it too, as the children exclaim, “Thank you! See you soon!”.

          Year 6 are children on the verge of adolescence, and they are a tough crowd to impress. So, when they arrive at their Tiny Forest with the sun shining in their faces, I am delighted to see they are ready to pick up the spades and get to work planting their legacy forest. Over the rest of the morning, they get to plant native trees in the unforgiving urban clay soil, and investigate the soil properties in and around their forest. The soil classification protocol is a funny one, requiring the children to make strange shapes that get them giggling and joking around, suddenly connected to their environment, coats hung up on the wooden fence, hands muddy.</p>
